        => Hello! I am a Software Engineer and Graphic Designer who happens to
        also love food and gaming (surprise). Since I was young, I've had a love
        for drawing, breaking stuff to see how it works, then re-building it
        (sometimes), hacking toys (and non-toys) and playing basketball (yes I
        go outside too). In technical high school, I took on Industrial Design
        as my elective. In college, I studied Industrial Engineering in the
        Philippines. I came to the US in 2000 and since then I've worked as a
        Graphic Designer. Recently, I chose to revive my interest and passion in
        software engineering so I took an Immersive Software Engineering course
        at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. <br />
        => Now I'm ready to find a position at a company where I can fulfill all
        these interests for me. My eye for design in conjunction with my coderâ€™s
        thinking provides a double-edged sword skillset that is applicable to a
        multitude of situations. <br />
        => Oh, I'm also a co-founder and partner of a startup food company
        specializing in Filipino food and products. <br />
        => Skilled in Full Stack Web Development, JavaScript, ReactJS, Gatsby,
        NextJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Python, Django, and whatever else that
        comes my way... <br />
