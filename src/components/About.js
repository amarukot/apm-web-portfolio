      <h3>
        => Hello! I am a Software Engineer and Graphic Designer who happens to
        also love food and gaming (surprise). Since I was young, I've had a love
        for drawing, breaking stuff to see how it works, then re-building it
        (sometimes), hacking toys (and non-toys) and playing basketball (yes I
        go outside too). In technical high school, I took on Industrial Design
        as my elective. In college, I studied Industrial Engineering in the
        Philippines. When I came to the US, I worked as a Graphic Designer. I
        recently completed an Immersive Software Engineering bootcamp at{" "}
        <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. <br />
        => Now I want to find a position and start a career that would fulfill
        all these interests for me. I normally approach problems like I approach
        video games and recipes… whether it’s trying to conquer each level
        (without cheats!) or tweaking a recipe to make it better. My eye for
        design in conjunction with my coder’s thinking provides a double-edged
        sword approach to a multitude of situations. Oh, I'm also a co-founder
        and partner of a startup food company specializing in Filipino food and
        products. <br />
        => Skilled in Full Stack Web Development, JavaScript, ReactJS, Gatsby,
        NextJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Python, Django, and whatever else that
        comes my way... <br />
